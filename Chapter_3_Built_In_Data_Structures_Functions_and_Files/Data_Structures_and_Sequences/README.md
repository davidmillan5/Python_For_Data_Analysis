# Built-In Data Structures, Functions, and Files

While add-on libraries like pandas, and NumPy add advanced computational functionality for larger datasets, they are designed to be used together with Python's built-in data manipulation tools.

we'll start with Python's workhorse data structures: tuples, lists, dictionaries, and sets. Then, we'll discuss creating your own reusable Python functions. Finally, we'll look at the mechanics of Python file objects and interacting with your local hard drive.
