# Functions

*Functions* are the primary and most important method of code
organization and reuse in Python. As a rule of thumb, if you
anticipate needing to repeat the same or very similar code more than
once, it may be worth writing a reusable function. Function can
also help make your code more readable by giving a name to a group of Python
statements.
